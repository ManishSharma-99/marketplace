# Skeleton loading  using only a few lines of CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/havardob/pen/dyGGGzq](https://codepen.io/havardob/pen/dyGGGzq).

By using background-image: linear-gradient I've created a "skeleton"-like loading-effect with just a few lines of code and  a simple CSS animation. 

Useful when you add content from an API and have to wait for the content to load
